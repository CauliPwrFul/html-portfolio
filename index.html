    <p>This is the first project that I completed as part of Dr Angela Yu's web development bootcamp. By the time I completed this project, I had learned about<br />
        Heading, Paragraph and Void elements. So, not tons, but enough to craft something. Whilst I completed this project before we learned about<br /> 
        the HTML boilerplate, I went back and added that it in so it's consistent with what I now know with this 3rd personal portfolio project. Aside from that <br /> 
        I want this to be an accurate representation of what I had learned at that particular point in the course. </p>

    <p>The birthday invitation project is my second project on the course, by which point we had progressed to cover Nesting, Indentation,
        <br /> Anchor Elements, Image Elements, File Paths and Web Pages. The progression from the movie ranking project to this project was
        <br /> immensely satisfying, although I must admit file paths and the boilerplate stuff was the first time I started feeling a bit more challenged.</p>
