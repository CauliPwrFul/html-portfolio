<h1>Sharah's Top Movies</h1>
<h2>My Favorite Flicks</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Jackie Brown</h3>
<p>Another classic from Quentin Tarantino. It was the first film of his that starred a black female lead<br /> 
and I loved all the action happening. This lyric from a song springs to mind every time I think of this movie,<br />
for some reason: 
<p>"Don't drink that wine,<br /> 
coke it is better, <br />
it's easy to find, <br />
if that won't do,<br /> 
smoke a joint or two, but don't drink that wine"</p>

<h3>Blues Brothers </h3>
<p>This movie is before my time, but my gosh did it have swagger for its time and tons of music.<br />
It stars Dan Ackroyd and has an ensemble cast to back it too. I think this was the movie that made<br />
me appreciate sing-songy movies, because generally I did not like them.</p>

<h3>Death Becomes Her</h3>
<p>Is this Meryl Streep's funniest role? Is this Bruce Willis' best supporting role? And do we agree this is Goldie<br /> 
Hawn's best work? Whether or not, I love everything about this movie and have watched it several times to boot. <br />
I wonder what I'd think of it if I watched it in the more enlightened technological age?</p>

<h3>Reservoir Dogs</h3>
<p>This is probably the movie that made me fall in love with Quentin Tarantino, his storytelling<br /> 
and his style of films. I loved that rather than reflecting 1 storyline that spans a longer period of time,<br />
he reflected the fact that SERIOUSLY FUNNY STUFF was happening to each character at the very same <br />
moment in time and that it was in the coming together at the end that we'd get the most enjoyment.</p>
